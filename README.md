# Search-solver-with-Netlogo

1. My project in CS420-Artificial Intelligence course.

2. My team:
    - Tien Nguyen Van (me)
    - Dat Thai Ngoc Thanh
    - Van Mai Thi Cam

    My responsible: entire project except creating 5 maps.

3. Purpose:
    - Using NetLogo to implement and visualize search algorithms with 4 algorithms: Breadth-first search, Depth-first search,  Uniform-cost search, A* search.
    - With 3 levels and 5 maps which have already been created.

4. Level:
    - Level 1: One algorithm, one agent, one start, one goal.
    - Level 2: Two algorithms, one agent, one start, two goals (the agent goes from start to goal, and goes back).
    - Level 3: Multiple agents(8), one goal, different starting points, and different algorithms.
